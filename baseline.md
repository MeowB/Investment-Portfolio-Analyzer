Let's break down the project to maximize productivity in a week. Here's how we can approach it:  

### Architecture and Tech Stack:  
1. **Backend:** Python (FastAPI or Flask) for quick API integration and data processing.  
2. **Data Fetching:** Finnhub Stock API for real-time stock prices and historical data.  
3. **Database:** SQLite (lightweight and fast for this project) to store user holdings.  
4. **Frontend:** Streamlit (quick setup for interactive dashboards) or React (more customization but more time-consuming).  
5. **Visualizations:** Plotly or Matplotlib for interactive charts.  

### Core Features:  
- **User Input:** Input stock ticker, quantity, and buy price.  
- **Real-Time Valuation:** Fetch current stock prices and calculate portfolio value.  
- **Profit/Loss Calculation:** Display individual and total profit/loss.  
- **Interactive Visualizations:** Pie chart for portfolio distribution, line chart for historical performance.  

### Development Timeline:  
- **Day 1:** Set up the project environment, integrate the Finnhub API, and fetch real-time stock data.  
- **Day 2:** Build the backend logic for profit/loss calculations and database integration.  
- **Day 3:** Develop the frontend UI for input and display of portfolio metrics.  
- **Day 4:** Implement interactive visualizations and charts.  
- **Day 5:** Testing, bug fixes, and performance optimization.  
- **Day 6:** Polish UI/UX and prepare for the interview presentation.  
- **Day 7:** Final review, deployment (if required), and interview preparation.
